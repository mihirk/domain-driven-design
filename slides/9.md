##  How to get Started

### On a Story level
-   Understanding the user requirement
-   Have a loose mindset towards declaring new "Classes" and "Functions"
-   Try and map out your code solution to the domain
-   Assign each and every class a "Singular" job or representation. Comment on top of the class what its responsibility should be

### On a Bigger level
-   Assign each and every service a boundary specific to the Domain. With a single job/responsibility.
